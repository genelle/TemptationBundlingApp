Temptation Bundling app - help break bad habits by bundling them with a reward

This is the first full-fledged (i.e. non-kata or homework) program that I have written. The hope is (someday) that this will be a cross-platform app, but for now I'm keeping it on the command line so I can just focus on the development. Any suggestions/tips are welcome and appreciated!

To-do for current state of program (command line):
**The following need to happen next time I work on this**
* need to create table to track what habits users have completed and what rewards they have cashed in
* need to keep track of user_id within program so I can add what the above new table will track easier

* set up cycling of points to "savings" for higher point amount rewards
* set up a more user friendly menu to choose from after establishing user id, and the functions to go along with them
* write up full documentation

Future ideas/to-do's:
* incorporate a gui to desktop app (wxPython?)
* learn to develop web apps, iOS, android, etc (maybe use kivy?)
* get better at programming!
